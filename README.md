# CybroScript

The general purpose programming language designed to have great integration with the following topics:
- Commandline & Shell execution
- Gui Application development for all types of operating systems, leveraging a framework known as "react-native,flutter&swiftui combined"
- Artificial finetuning, developing & inferencing
- Operating system integration (With a wrapper & also a standalone operating system.)

# Development

Currently this is just the surface of what we want to cover. We would like to have the language have a style similar to golang+swift combined, as those make for 2 pretty great programming languages.

The development of this framework/language will take a tremendous long time, as we need to develop many different kinds of layers, known as cybro-os, and other parts that fits nicely onto this language. But for now we are going to just focus on getting a basic jit repl working, following the craftinginterpreters.com.
